Ever tried coding a website in Drupal on a PIII PC with only 128 MB RAM and the following applications running: Dreamweaver 8, Photoshop 7, WS FTP, Sygate Personal Firewall, Apache, MySQL Server 5.0, and Winamp 2.7?

Bonus question: Who in hell's name came up with the abomination that is fat-free ice cream?
