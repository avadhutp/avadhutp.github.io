This site is mostly a resource. 

I am surrounded by some incredibly talented people&mdash;both at work and otherwise. I learn a lot from them everyday: new techniques to make Solr commit almost realtime to amazing new songs from the Shruti box project. This place serves as a collection of all such things that I never want to lose.
