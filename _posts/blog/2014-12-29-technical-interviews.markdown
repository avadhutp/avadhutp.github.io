1. What are the x(3) things I want to know about the candidate that I'm unlikely to find out even after I ask all the questions. Two important rules here:
   + These things should be relevant. For example, that the candidate plays ice-hockey does not really help sell him/her to me.
   + The candidate should not bother about his/her experience with technical tools relevant to the job: anything of relevance in this area would be covered via my usual line of questioning.
1. Do not make the interview an excercise in "Guess what I'm thinking."
   + Apart from evaluating the hard technical skills (which is close to inaccurate), focus on the softer skillsâ€”juggling priorities, analysing requirements, writing technical documentation.
1. Ask about things the candidate is good at
   + So if he/she claimed (on CV) that they _drove the adoption of .NET_, focus on the _drove_, ask them to elucidate.
   + Ask about projects they worked on, whether they worked in a team or alone, how did they influence the direction of the project (if at all), toughest challenge, easiest thing to do.
