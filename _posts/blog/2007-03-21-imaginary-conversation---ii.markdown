**She:** I bought another pair of shoes yesterday! Clogs.

**He:** I bought another USB drive yesterday. 2 gigs. What do you do with so many shoes anyway?

**She:** I assign weights to each pair and decide which pair to wear each day such that the distribution of their weights is a Gaussian with a mean of 2.5 and variance that is 3.75 times the rate at which my brain cells multiplied in the previous month. What do you do with all those USB drives anyway?

**He:** I just use them to store all the data I have so that I don't need to delete anything. Ever!

**She:** That's just pathetic! You could not even come up with a pseudo-random process? And everyone thinks you are the eccentric genius and I am Jessica Simpson. It's all about your 'little Einstien' look, isnt' it?

**He:** Of course! My friend, image is everything.
