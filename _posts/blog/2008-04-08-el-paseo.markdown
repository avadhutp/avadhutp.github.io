Had a fun weekend, this last one. Rode off to Kashid. Three bikes—a Bullet 500, a Bullet 350, and an Avenger—and three cars—a Honda Civic, a Honda City, and an Accent.

This is all that we broke between Mukul's (the 350) and my (the 500) bike.

**The 500 (1998 Royal Enfield Bullet 500cc-Cast Iron Engine):**

1. The rubber lever on the gear shifter.
1. The sump gaurd.
1. One of the horns "magically" fell off! ::gulp::
1. Gaurd mounts broke.
1. I think I have worn off the valve liners too.
1. The wheel bearings are definitely legally dead. :)

**The 350 (Royal Enfield Bullet Machismo 350cc-AVL Engine):**
1. The oil pump had temporarily given up on us.
1. The clutch cable.
1. Earthing wire came off.
1. Misfiring.

The night we travelled to Kashid, both bulls were regularly spitting fire everytime we slowed down from 100-110 KMPH, causing poor Kiran to keep safe distance. LoL.

All in all, good fun.
