<p>I discovered three new tools today that I am definitely using for my next project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;http://html5please.us: A mistake most web developers make, especially when making websites geared toward modern browsers, is blindly using all HTML5/CSS3 features possible. Some of these are still experimental and need to be avoided or used with fallbacks. This site is the perfect primer/reference for such decisions:</p>

<p>2. http://caniuse.com: If (and you&#39;d be brave if you aren&#39;t) use Google Analytics, you can determine the browser share of your users and determine what features you want to use and what should be used with fallbacks:</p>

<p>3. Opera Dragonfly Style Profiler (http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/style-profiler-preview): CSS DOM selection is often neglected when performing website optimizations. This can have a significant impact on your site&#39;s speed. Opera&#39;s Dragonfly can help you optimize CSS selector matching for optimal performance:</p>

<p>Do you know of any others? Please share :-)</p>
