By no means do I know the city well. I've been there twice, but for a good 3 weeks each time. Sad to say though, I was stuck in Manhattan both the times. There is a slim chance that I might go again there this year. So I am creating a wishlist.

First off, these are things that I've loved doing in this city. And hope that this time around too, I'd be able to do some of them:

1. The minute you land, you make your way to [Katz's](http://katzsdelicatessen.com/). Nothing cures jetlag like Katz's pastrami-on-rye sandwich, washed down with a Dr. Brown's cream soda. The bread barely contains the meat that is oozing out on all four sides. Legend has it that Katz's actually does not make any profits on this gargantuan sandwich. They could cut back on the meat and increase their margins, but that would be sacrilegious to the owners. You can see the effor that goes into cooking the brisket to perfection, as all the action takes place right behind the counter. _Bonus_: This is also the same place where Meg Ryan famously faked an orgasm in _When Harry met Sally_, and they have a sign reminding you of that (ツ)). ![katz deli](/images/blog/katz.jpg)

1. In the evening, go to [Union Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Square,_Manhattan) and just watch people doing all kinds of things. Some weird, some not so weird. Then, I'd make my way to [Mamoun's Falafel](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mamouns-falafel-new-york) and have a hot-sauce-doused shawarma, followed by a big fat baklava. While I digest, I'd walk to [Chocolate by the bald man](http://maxbrenner.com/locations/usa/restaurant-nyc/), and get a nice hot chocolate to go—I'm always torn between getting either the marshmallow, choco-pops, or hazelnut one. Life is full of tough choices. ![Mamoun's Falafel](/images/blog/mamouns.jpg)

1. If, during your walks around NY (of which there should be many), you land anywhere near Rockefeller Centre, Upper West, or Grand Central, you should make a beeline for [Magnolia](http://www.magnoliabakery.com/). Do not get distracted by the cupcakes, pastries, meringues, or the cookies kept on display. Just go up to the counter and ask for the Banana pudding. You will not be disappointed. And if you're anything like me, will try to get one on the day your plane leaves too. ![Magnolia's banana pudding](/images/blog/magnolia-banana-pudding.jpg)

1. The next one's a bit obscure. When I was working for [StepOut](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stepout), our office used to on the intersection between 36th and Madison. I discovered [Akura Sushi](http://www.akurasushi.com/location.aspx) place a short walk from there. Beware, this isn't exactly a purist sushi lover's wet dream. In fact quiet the opposite. It serves up New York style sushi, which is quiet a departure from the fare you'd get in an authentic sushi place. But I like this place because they make it just the way I like it. My favorites—spicy tuna, tempura, and a coke. Sit behind the counter lit with neons and watch as your food's being prepared with clinical precision. Perfect for a quiet night out alone. ![Akura Sushi, NYC](/images/blog/akura.jpg)

1. If you're in China Town, you have to eat at [Golden Unicorn](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/golden-unicorn-new-york). You go here, in my experience, to get yelled at, for the funnily atrocious service, and for amazing dumplings—chicken feet, pork buns, spinach and shrimp, etc. Just look on the lighter side of things when you are faced with a middle-aged Chinese lady yelling at you for not getting your order right the first time around. ![Golden Unicorn, NYC](/images/blog/golden-unicorn.jpg)

1. Finally, no visit to New York's complete for me without a meal at [Tick Tock Diner](http://www.ticktockdinerny.com/Tick_Tock_Diner_N.Y..html). You'll get everything on their huge menu from burgers and crinkle-cut fries to a strip steak 24 hours a day, in typical diner style. I love this place because the portions are big and delicious, and because I spent some good time here with some of my closest friends, who back then were living in NY. Might not appeal to everyone, but I go there for sentimental reasons. Empire State Building is a short walk from here, and believe me you'll need a walk to digest all that food. It is worth seeing it in the night, when the top lights up and looks absolutely amazing. ![Tick Tock Diner, NYC](/images/blog/tick-tock.jpg)

1. This last one's a bonus. I've never really been here, but I've wanted to ever since I hear of it—[Rincon Criollo](http://rinconcriollo.wix.com/rincon-criollo), and it is partly because of the name. It sounds so … wonderful. I first saw it on _Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives_, and have wanted to eat here ever since. What really caught my eye are the refried plantains. They do sound amazing. And this one will take me out of Manhattan, so yay! ![Rincon Criollo](/images/blog/rincon-criollo.jpg)
