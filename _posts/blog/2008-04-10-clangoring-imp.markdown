Once, long ago, she pinned this on my softboard during halloween:
<blockquote>A gentle breeze rustling the dry cornstalks

A sound is heard, a goblin walks

A harvest moon suffers a black cat's cry.

Oh' do witched fly!

The bonfire catches a pumpkin's gleam.

Rejoice, it's Halloween!</blockquote>
She used to award me "stars" for good behavior and "commas" for bad.

She always thought that I'd choose spelunking over food.

And she thought that my favorite game was mudpie-mudpie.

Then she was gone.

Now, she's finally [here](http://jumbleberrypie.wordpress.com/).
