A few days ago, I came across a collection of design-related quotes over at [sysprog.net](http://www.sysprog.net). Below, a couple of my favorites:

> In the beginning we must simplify the subject, thus unavoidably falsifying it, and later we must sophisticate away the falsely simple beginning.
-Maimonides

> Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.
-Edward V Berard

> You can only put as much intelligence in a system as was in the design engineer to begin with.
-Peter Orme

> When one has no character, one has to apply a method.
-Albert Camus

> A creative man is motivated by the desire to achieve, not by the desire to beat others.
-Ayn Rand

> Man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic.
-Fyodor Dostoevsky

> If you cannot grok the overall structure of a program while taking a shower, you are not ready to code it.
-Richard Pattis

> Designers must do two seemingly contradictory things at the same time: They must design for perfection, and they must design as though errors are inevitable. And they must do the second without compromising the first.
-Bob Colwell

> The two main design principles of the NeXT machine appear to be revenge and spite.
-Don Lancaster

> Very often, people confuse simple with simplistic. The nuance is lost on most.
-Clement Mok

> It requires a very unusual mind to undertake the analysis of the obvious.
-Alfred North Whitehead

> Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence; he is just using his memory.
-Leonardo da Vinci

> Much of the Web is like an anthill built by ants on LSD.
-Jakob Nielsen

> Form follows function - that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union.
-Frank Lloyd Wright

> Quality isn't something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a Christmas tree.
-Robert Pirsig

> Crash programs fail because they are based on the theory that with nine women pregnant, you can get a baby a month.
-Wernher von Braun

> Out of intense complexities, emerge intense simplicities.
-Winston Churchill
