_When doves cry_ by Prince ~~was~~is the awesomest song. Ever. The problem is, sometime in 2007, he woke up one morning and decided that people should not listen to his music anymore. So Youtube did what needed to be done and made sure that all videos that used Prince's music don't do so anymore. A shame. I couldn't listen to Prince whenever I wanted to feel cool!

With a little snooping around though, I found this. Hopefully, Prince won't mind. For now:
