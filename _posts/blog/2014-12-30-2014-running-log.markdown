I started running in April-2013, six months after I moved to London. I hadn't run, for fitness, ever before in my life. I mean I used to play football, but running wasn't an activity I indulged in exclusively. Partly because I had no time and partly because Bombay roads aren't the most conducive places to go for a run. In 2013-December, when I tried going for a run in Bombay,

* dogs chased me
* people stared at me as if I was stark raving mad
* my mother almost called the emergency services after about 30 mins
* I came back home covered in soot

I like running. I like being alone. And therefore, I usually run alone. Mostly, just with a small radio. It has now become by preferred mode of (solo) transport in London—it is faster than using a bus, train, or taxi.

It also makes me eat healthier. I have a terrible sweet tooth and can't resist anything that is baked/fried. But I like to keep my weight under a check to help me go faster for longer when I'm running. So, almost invariably, I tend to police myself when faced with temptations. However, cakes are still an exception. ◕ ◡ ◕

2014's been a good year. Overall:

![stats](/images/blog/run-stats.png)

I was able to

* Hit 85 kms per week for an entire month
* Up my weekly long runs to 30 kms
* Hit sub-5-minute times on 10 km runs

Also, I

* switched to VivoBarefoot Training Clinic One (previously I used New Balance Minimus MR00)
* Bought a Garmin Forerunner 110

The only hiccup (a happy one) was that I had a baby boy in November. So November 15th was my last running day in 2014.

Hopefully, 2015 will be a 3k year!
