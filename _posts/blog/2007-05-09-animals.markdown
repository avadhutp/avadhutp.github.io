a. My sink invariably has an ant[1] that keeps scurrying around pointlessly. I always wait till it's at a safe place before turning on the tap. I used to think that I was just trying to be a nice person, but now I think that it's just that the ant reminds me of myself.

b. Yesterday, I went to my sister's place to pick up some stuff. I was trying to park the bike in her building compound and there was this huge dog who acted like he[2] simply did'nt like the idea. I ended up spending 20 mins circling the building till the dog went away. He did'nt. I did.

[1]  don't know the ant(s) well enough to know if it's the same ant, but there's always one numbers of ant in the sink.

[2] or she; who knows these things.
