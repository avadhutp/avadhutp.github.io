And finally, everythings paid off—the off-Saturday I worked on, endless hours spent in reading everything about social networking, several accounts opened on all types of social networking sites to see what they are all about. Everything.

On Monday, I made the final presentation on my collaborative knowledge management system to my CEO, CIO, and Web team head. It seemed that all they needed was a little push, and I was more than willing to be the one to provide it.

The icing on the cake is that I will working on this project **alone**; for two whole months that too, which means I can reignite my old romance with PHP for a third time (the last time I abandoned it was more than 2 years ago, after my EXL project). A truly Web-enabled language, PHP's association with MySQL and Apache is almost legendary. Heck, WordPress itself is powered by PHP and MySQL, and so is Drupal! I could'nt be more excited.
