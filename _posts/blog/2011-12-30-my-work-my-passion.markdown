I came across an article titled [Be passionate about work: No job change required](http://gigaom.com/collaboration/be-passionate-about-work-no-job-change-required/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=webworkerdaily) in my Twitter timeline today. It tries to answer a very basic question--how does one work on things he/she is passionate about everyday? Do they search for that *calling* or do we simply try to change the context of our current job to make it seem less _boring_.

I realized that I am very lucky in that aspect. For the past 6 years I've been working at a place that I love. Doing things that I love. I found [Cactus](http://www.cactusglobal.com) in 2007 through a friend--and I'll always remain thankful to him for it. And today this place is as much mine as it is my CEOs who founded the company. It is not a place where I work, it a place where I do what I enjoy doing--sadly there is no word for it.

Here, I don't have to dichotomize work and what my passions really are. I don't have to wait till the fag end of the day or the weekends to do what I like doing. My passions don't remain tucked away under the folds until the time is right for me to play with them. I can do what I love every single day. 

Amazing isn't it?
