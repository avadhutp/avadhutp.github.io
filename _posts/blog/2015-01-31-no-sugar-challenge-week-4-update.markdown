## The best song in the world

Imagine you met someone, say 30 years old, who had never heard a sound their entire life. And today was the first time that person was going to hear something. You were tasked with choosing a song, the very first song, that this person will ever listen to. What song would you choose? Jo Milne was one such person. And a friend of hers put together a [playlist](http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/76399) for her. I would not want to be that friend.

Tomorrow, I am going to experience something like that. Well, I am being overly dramatic, but still.

It's been a month now since I stopped eating sugar or anything with added sugar in it. And tomorrow, as the challenge completes, I get to eat something sweet. The reward. And I just can't make my mind up as to what I should eat. An almond croissant? A cake? Perhaps I should keep it simple and stick to an ice-cream. I know, though, that whatever it is I eat, I am going to savour that bite for a long time. Because to experience that sensation again I'd have to deprive myself for an entire month. Something I don't look forward to doing ever again.

## What next?

So, I never really wanted to give up sugar completely. There's just too much to experience in this world to shut yourself completely to one aspect. Nope. Not happening. However, I will restrict my intake so that when I do eat, I'll enjoy it thoroughly. So—

* I'll try to not eat sugar on weekedays
* I am definitely not drinking any fizzy drinks—they're a perfectly good waste of calories
* I will avoid, as far as possible, things with unnecessarily added sugar in them—american peanut butter brands, cereals, ketchups, etc.

## Award time

This week, I have two to hand out.

The good one first. And the award for being the _Good Guy_, and not tempting me, goes to Cristian Arcaroli. The good soul that he is, he did not post pictures of what he ate when we was holidaying in Italy. Also, we got back loads of stuff from Italy, and he is waiting till February 1st to get them to work.

I have to look no further than my own wife, for the third time in a row, to hand out the award for _Intolerable Cruelty_! This week, her transgressions this week included

* brownies being dipped in peanut butter and consumed in front of me
* baking biscottis
* and the continue consumption of copious amounts of Nutella
